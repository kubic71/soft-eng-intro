# Trip suggester
Trip suggester is a tool designed to help tourists explore cities and other interesting locations. It combines various services, events, and activities into one-day trip plans. Users have the opportunity to express their preferences about a trip, what they would like to see and experience in their destination. Our system will suggest various trip possibilities best suiting their needs.

Users can specify their starting place and their destination. The system will find suitable transport options (trains, buses) to get them there and back. Furthermore, users can choose which types of activities they would like to do, what kind of sights they would like to see, if they would like to go to a restaurant for a lunch, to a bar in the evening and so on. Our system will come up with trips satisfying user demands. It is possible to filter trips based on total price, service reviews, length, etc. 

Our system provides a way for businesses and small service providers to add their offers and it can find additional activities and things to do on the internet.

Users can use the free or premium paid version of our system. The premium version allows more flexibility in specifying trip preferences.
